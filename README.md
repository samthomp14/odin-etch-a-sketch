# odin-etch-a-sketch

This is an assignment from The Oding Project to practice putting javascript together with HTML and CSS to make a full fledged webpage. 

The page includes a drawer interface similar to etch-a-sketch. As you drag your mouse across the grid pixels change colors. You can also reset the grid and choose a custom grid resolution.
